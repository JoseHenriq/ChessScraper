ChessCom scraper
-----------------
## DISCLAIMER

I have not tried scraping live online chess games. Google chrome knows an automated driver (bot) is using it so chess.com shouldnt have issues detecting if you are using Selenium to scrape online live games. I dont know if they check for this and I dont know if they would consider it suspicious activity and ban you. 

However I tried scraping offline chess games and it works. This is what I am talking about:
https://www.chess.com/play/computer

That URL allows you to play offline live games against a computer which means you dont have to log into the webpage. The HTML structure used on that URL and on the live chess server is exactly the same as of 05/05/2018 so you should be able to scrape live games if you felt like it.
