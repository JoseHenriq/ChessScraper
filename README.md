# ChessScraper
Web scraper designed for chess.com

This is a webscraper designed to retrieve PGNs from famous chess website, chess.com 

The main libraryor API that makes all of this possible is Selenium. I connect to the webpage with it and retrieve all the text. I just format it and display it in a pretty (I hope so) GUI. This is a pretty basic scraper and you can easily modify the code to fit your needs. This is hopefully the beginning of a crazy scraping spree, I hope to give the PGNs a good use. 

As of right now only games that have ended can be scraped. Working on being able to scrape live games.
