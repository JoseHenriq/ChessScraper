# ChessScraper
Web scraper designed for chess.com

This is a scraper. This is used to get data out of a website. The scraper is built in Java and uses JSOUP to interact with the web. It already comes with a GUI but all front-end is separated from back-ends so you can only use the methods if that rocks your boat. 

The initial idea for this scraper was just to be a simple scraper capable of gathering PGNs from chess.com games but it may evolve or may have already evolved to other things.
